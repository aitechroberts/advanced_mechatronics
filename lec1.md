Low pass filter
- Capacitor after resistor
High pass filter
- Capacitor before resistor

Banded = both
- Aka voltage within a band

# Inductor turn-off problem
- Inductors being turned off in a microsecond can generate tremendous voltage due to the existing current wanting to continue, and the Voltage equation for an inductor being V = L * di/dt, so the rate of change of the current generates a ton of voltage.
    - Can protect the circuit by preventing the circuit from being closed at all, and therefore a diode would be useful because you can prevent the circuit from getting parallel resistance with that protection
